# Day 1

so... i guess this is the day i start documenting shit i have been through daily to the public for no reason at all!


today was meh to be honest


still happy inside that i didnt really get dysphoria today


my sister was a screeching and annoying ipad kiddo today, again, but the funny part is that she doesnt really play with her tablet etc. that much anymore


my dad was again not able to sleep today thanks to us


i still felt like a dumbass today


i feel like i am tripping every fucking second


my family atleast started to stop the mental abuse they had on me for some reason though???


so i mean atleast that was cool


i actually dont know what to write as i really dont like explaining my feelings and shit


then you might ask why i am doing this


and that is because i just saw people comment daily entries on the funny sogn teto terraritory and though it may be healthy


thats all...
